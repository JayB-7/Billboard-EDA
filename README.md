### This is a data analysis project on basis of a kaggle dataset (link : https://www.kaggle.com/dhruvildave/billboard-the-hot-100-songs) where I have explored the data and then focused on the ranking of a specific artist and shown relevant visualisations.

### Python libraries used: Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib
